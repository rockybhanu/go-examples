In Debian (and Linux systems in general), the best location to install application binaries like JetBrains GoLand (or other IDEs) depends on whether you want it to be available system-wide or just for a specific user.

### Recommended Installation Locations:

#### 1. **System-wide Installation (Recommended for Multi-User Access)**
If you want all users to access GoLand, you should install it under:

- **`/opt` (Recommended)**
    - This directory is intended for optional software packages.
    - Example installation steps:

      ```bash
      sudo mkdir -p /opt/goland
      sudo tar -xzf GoLand-*.tar.gz -C /opt/goland --strip-components=1
      ```

    - You can create a symbolic link for easier access:

      ```bash
      sudo ln -s /opt/goland/bin/goland.sh /usr/local/bin/goland
      ```

    - Run the IDE with the command:

      ```bash
      goland
      ```

- **Alternative Locations (Less Common)**
    - `/usr/local/share`: If you prefer the application to be placed alongside manually installed software.
    - `/usr/local/bin`: For executables, but not recommended for large applications.

---

#### 2. **User-Specific Installation (Recommended for Single User)**
If you only want to install GoLand for your user, use:

- **`~/opt` (Personal software directory)**
    - Example:

      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/opt/goland
      tar -xzf GoLand-*.tar.gz -C ~/opt/goland --strip-components=1
      ```

    - Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

      ```bash
      export PATH="$HOME/opt/goland/bin:$PATH"
      ```

    - Then, run GoLand with:

      ```bash
      goland
      ```

### 3. **Creating a Desktop Launcher**
Once installed, follow these steps to create a launcher:

1. Create a `.desktop` file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.local/share/applications/goland.desktop
   ```

2. Add the following content:

   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Version=1.0
   Type=Application
   Name=GoLand
   Comment=JetBrains GoLand IDE
   Exec=/opt/goland/bin/goland.sh
   Icon=/opt/goland/bin/goland.svg
   Terminal=false
   Categories=Development;IDE;
   ```

3. Save and close (`Ctrl+X`, `Y`).

4. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/goland.desktop
   ```

Now, GoLand should appear in your application menu under **Development**.

### 4. **Keeping GoLand Updated**
JetBrains GoLand provides an update mechanism within the IDE itself, but you can also manually update it by replacing the existing files in `/opt/goland` or `~/opt/goland`.

---

### Summary (Best Practice Recommendations)
- Use **`/opt/goland`** for system-wide installation.
- Use **`~/opt/goland`** for personal installation.
- Use `goland.desktop` for easy access from the application menu.
